## Unreleased

- **The agent files say that file edits go through the `Edit` tool**, and
  they name both reasons rather than only the familiar one. An edit must be
  able to fail, which is why a shell substitution that misses its pattern is
  an unverified edit. And no Bash command line exists, so the commit gate has
  nothing to read.

  The second reason is what a session hit. The gate looks inside a heredoc
  body on purpose, because a commit hidden in one used to walk straight past
  it. Where a repository's test fixtures are themselves shell command
  strings — this one's are — a heredoc that patches such a fixture carries a
  commit the gate must ask about, for a command that commits nothing. The
  prompt then reaches whoever is at the keyboard, which in an unattended run
  is nobody. (#34)

  The gate is unchanged. Whether it should skip a heredoc body that is being
  written to a file rather than run is a separate decision, and it is
  recorded as an open question on the work item instead of being made here.

## 0.0.1 — 2026-08-31

- **Initial release.** An implement/review agent chain with hook enforcement,
  an evidence ledger with drift detection, and a tool-agnostic review handoff
  protocol.

  The gates ship opt-in: a repository is judged only once it says so, and
  every gate that cannot read its input fails toward asking rather than
  toward silence. `specs/` holds a work item's documents and
  `.specseal/` holds the ledger that points into the code.
