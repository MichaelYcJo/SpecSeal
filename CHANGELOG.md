## Unreleased

- **The agent files say that file edits go through the `Edit` tool**, and
  they name both reasons rather than only the familiar one. An edit must be
  able to fail, which is why a shell substitution that misses its pattern is
  an unverified edit. And no Bash command line exists, so the commit gate has
  nothing to read.

  The second reason is what a session hit. The gate reads a heredoc body as
  shell, because a commit hidden in one used to walk straight past it, and
  two kinds of segment count. One has a commit in it: a command word of
  `git` with the `commit` subcommand, which a partial patch to a file
  carrying shell commands as test data can leave in command position, and
  which a document showing a waiver example carries on purpose. The other
  has no commit at all: a segment the reader cannot expand, so an `eval`
  argument holding a variable, a command substitution or a glob stops the
  session with no `git` in the body. Neither command commits anything, and
  the prompt reaches whoever is at the keyboard — in an unattended run,
  nobody. (#34)

  The gate is unchanged. Whether it should skip a heredoc body that is being
  written to a file rather than run is a separate decision, and it is
  recorded as an open question on the work item instead of being made here.

## 0.0.1 — 2026-08-31

- **Initial release.** An implement/review agent chain with hook enforcement,
  an evidence ledger with drift detection, and a tool-agnostic review handoff
  protocol.

  The gates ship opt-in: a repository is judged only once it says so, and
  every gate that cannot read its input fails toward asking rather than
  toward silence. `specs/` holds a work item's documents and
  `.specseal/` holds the ledger that points into the code.
