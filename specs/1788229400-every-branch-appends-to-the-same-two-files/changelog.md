- **Every branch appended to the same two files, and one of them broke at the
  merge.** Three branches ran in parallel on 2026-09-01, touched 34 files, and
  shared exactly one — `CHANGELOG.md`, in all three pairs. Nothing else
  overlapped at all, so parallel work was never what conflicted: appending to
  one three-line region was. The cost is when the conflict arrives, after the
  broad gate has run and before the pull request opens, where nothing may be
  edited — so resolving it buys a second run of the whole broad gate. Both
  registries are now written one fragment per work item, and no two work items
  share an id. **A changelog entry goes in `specs/<work-item-id>/changelog.md`**
  and `.github/scripts/gather_changelog.py --version X.Y.Z` concatenates the
  ungathered ones into a dated section at the release; `--check` reports any
  that never arrived, and the hygiene workflow runs it on every pull request
  into `main`, so a release cannot ship a change with no entry. Each gathered
  entry sits under an HTML comment naming its work item — invisible to a
  reader, and the only link from a released entry back to the work that
  produced it. Matching the text instead would have worked once: any later
  copy-edit to a released entry would make its fragment read as ungathered
  forever. `## Unreleased` is gone with the region it named. (#46)

- **A ledger coordinate names content, not a position.** A row cited
  `path/file.py:120-134`, and a line number moves for edits that have nothing
  to do with the claim — so inserting a line above a cited function left the
  row pointing at the wrong lines while still reporting OK. Everything built to
  manage that was compensation: the coordinate rotted, so the row was
  re-anchored, so whatever it was measured from reset, so a stamp was needed,
  so a squash orphaned the stamp.

  **A row now cites `path#anchor@hash`.** The anchor is a symbol name where the
  language offers one — `.py` is read with the stdlib `ast`, so `Class.method`
  names a span exactly and nothing is installed to do it — and otherwise a
  distinctive line of text in quotes. The hash covers the region under the
  anchor with trailing whitespace and blank lines removed, so a reformat is not
  a change; indentation is kept, because in Python a dedent moves a statement
  out of the block it belonged to.

  The verdicts follow from that. **BROKEN** where the anchor is gone or appears
  more than once — an ambiguous anchor is refused loudly rather than measured,
  since with two places to look an OK would be a claim about whichever one the
  code reached first. **DRIFTED** where the content under it changed.
  **OK** prints the region's current line numbers, for a reader to open. There
  is no baseline, no stamp, no commit SHA in any row, and `evidence-check`
  calls git for nothing at all.

  **Re-verifying a row is recomputing its hash**, so it has a flag:
  `evidence-check --reverify` rewrites every resolvable row and names what it
  changed. It is deliberately separate from the check — one that refreshed what
  it was checking would report OK for ever — and it leaves a row whose anchor
  is gone alone, because that is the one row somebody has to look at.

  What this closes rather than manages: a stamp a squash can orphan, a row
  whose coordinate resolves while pointing at the wrong lines, a coordinate
  into a file newer than the baseline that could never drift, and a row that
  was stale the moment it landed because another branch changed the cited code
  and merged first. That last one had been recorded as unreachable; a content
  hash sees it on the first run, because there is no time window to look at.
