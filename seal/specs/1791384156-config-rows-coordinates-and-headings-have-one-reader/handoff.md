# 1791384156-config-rows-coordinates-and-headings-have-one-reader — handoff

Written 2026-10-08 by the orchestrating session, for a session on another
machine. The whole run's state, the owner's batch and the starting notes are
in `seal/specs/1791382684-every-reader-and-record-is-inventoried/handoff.md`
on branch `chore/834-every-reader-and-record-is-inventoried`; read it first.

| | |
|---|---|
| Issue(s) | #867 |
| State | framed by `framer` on Fable 5.1; `routing.md` answered `automation`; no smith spawned; `plan.md` not approved |
| Owner's questions | None for a person. The two formats it left out are filed as #871 and #872. |
| Build order | Shares `evidence_check.py` with #836 and #870; build first of the three. |

**Next act:** the owner's answers to every open row of the run, asked
together in one call; then fill `plan.md`'s `Approved <date> by <who>` line
and spawn smith on this branch. In a fresh worktree, run tests with
`bin/test <files>`; `uv run --frozen pytest` cannot start pytest there.
