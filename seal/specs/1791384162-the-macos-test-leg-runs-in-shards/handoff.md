# 1791384162-the-macos-test-leg-runs-in-shards — handoff

Written 2026-10-08 by the orchestrating session, for a session on another
machine. The whole run's state, the owner's batch and the starting notes are
in `seal/specs/1791382684-every-reader-and-record-is-inventoried/handoff.md`
on branch `chore/834-every-reader-and-record-is-inventoried`; read it first.

| | |
|---|---|
| Issue(s) | #864 |
| State | framed by `framer` on Fable 5.1; `routing.md` answered `automation`; no smith spawned; `plan.md` not approved |
| Owner's questions | None for a person. The stale `.test_durations` it found is #874, the owner's to run. |
| Build order | Independent. Smith cannot push: after phase 1 the session pushes and dispatches `test.yml` on this branch (or opens the draft pull request first), and phase 2 reads that run. |

**Next act:** the owner's answers to every open row of the run, asked
together in one call; then fill `plan.md`'s `Approved <date> by <who>` line
and spawn smith on this branch. In a fresh worktree, run tests with
`bin/test <files>`; `uv run --frozen pytest` cannot start pytest there.
