# 1791384153-a-ledger-rows-claim-is-the-test-that-enforces-it — handoff

Written 2026-10-08 by the orchestrating session, for a session on another
machine. The whole run's state, the owner's batch and the starting notes are
in `seal/specs/1791382684-every-reader-and-record-is-inventoried/handoff.md`
on branch `chore/834-every-reader-and-record-is-inventoried`; read it first.

| | |
|---|---|
| Issue(s) | #836 |
| State | framed by `framer` on Fable 5.1; `routing.md` answered `automation`; no smith spawned; `plan.md` not approved |
| Owner's questions | Q1 for the owner (a bulk pass over released rows?), default (a). |
| Build order | Shares `evidence_check.py` with #867 and #870; build after #867. |

**Next act:** the owner's answers to every open row of the run, asked
together in one call; then fill `plan.md`'s `Approved <date> by <who>` line
and spawn smith on this branch. In a fresh worktree, run tests with
`bin/test <files>`; `uv run --frozen pytest` cannot start pytest there.
